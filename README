README

This here is a small and simple shared c library that implements two functions 
inspired by the BSD libc (and one other):

1. statfs_ext()

This is the same as the standard linux statfs() call except the struct returned 
has a few more useful fields added.

2. getfsstat_linux()

This is an implementation of the BSD getfsstat() call, which returns an array 
of statfs_ext structs, one for every mounted file system.

and 3. getmntpt()

This function returns the mount point for the device or ramdisk or whatever for 
any file or directory PATH that exists on a currently mounted FS..

Please note that binary-compatibility may break often while the library is young
as I flesh out the functions and lock down the public interface. I will be using
semantic numbering (ie: 1.a.b), so 'b' version bumps will be backwards compatible,
while 'a' version bumps may not be.
