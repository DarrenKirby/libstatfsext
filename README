README

This here is a small and simple shared c library that implements two functions 
inspired by the BSD libc:

1. statfs_ext()

This is the same as the standard linux statfs() call except the struct retured 
has a few more useful fields added.

2. getfsstat_linux()

This is an implementation of the BSD getfsstat() call, which returns an array 
of statfs_ext structs, one for every mounted file system.
