INSTALL directions for libstatfsext:

After unpacking the tarball or pulling from git 'cd' into the top-level directory.

From there you can type:

$ make

to build the library. Then type:

$ sudo make install

to install the library system-wide. The library is currently installed to /usr/lib,
the header file to /usr/include, and the man pages to /usr/share/man/man3. I will
work on adding an install prefix soon.

Other make targets include:

test - build the library and two small test programs

strip - strips the library of debugging symbols

debug - builds the library with debugging symbols

uninstall - removes all installed files. Must be root or 'sudo'.

clean - removes all object files and binaries from the source tree.
